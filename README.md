## Usage
The script will manage the files in the `src` folder

To compile your code you only have to run `npm run compile`. This will compile any `.riot` file, transpile any `.ts` (not `.d.ts`) file and copy anything else.

If you want the script to continuously checking for changes in your files and compile them automatically when changed, you should use `npm run compile:watch`
